## This is a Native-Script Vue App

## This is also my first App

## Setup
     1) npm install -g nativescript (if you don't have native-script globally)
     2) tns/ns for testing the native-script already installed globally (ns = nativescript)
     3) tns/ns preview for make an qr code of the App

** You can install an emulator on your pc by following https://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-win
